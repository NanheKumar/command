macOS
The easiest way to install Minikube on macOS is using Homebrew:

brew cask install minikube


If you have previously installed minikube, and run:
minikube start

And this command returns an error:
machine does not exist

You need to wipe the configuration files:
rm -rf ~/.minikube

This will be show detail
 minikube -v10 start 
 
 Note : install vertualbox before start minikube


TIP : You can run minikube ssh to log into the Minikube VM and explore it
from the inside. For example, you may want to see what processes are running on the node.
