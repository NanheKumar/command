The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To restart nginx after an upgrade:
  brew services restart nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/nginx/bin/nginx -g daemon off;

Disable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP.
Hide these hints with HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS (see `man brew`).
